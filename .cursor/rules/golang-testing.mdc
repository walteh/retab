Golang Testing, Mocks, and Debugging Guidelines

Testing
	•	Test Case Naming:
	•	Use snake_case (e.g., test_case_name).
	•	Avoid spaces and special characters in test names.
	•	Assertions & Mocking:
	•	Use testify/assert for assertions.
	•	Use testify/require for error checks.
	•	Use testify/mock for creating mocks.
	•	Code Testability:
	•	Write code that is deliberately easy to test.
	•	Keep unit tests simple, clear, and highly exhaustive, focusing on breadth over complexity.
	•	Testing Workflow:
	•	Single-focus mode: Stick to one task at a time (e.g., testing, writing code, refactoring).
	•	Always run lints and tests before switching between these modes.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Be careful when modifying *_test.go files and regular Go files in the same composer run.
	•	Always add messages to assertions, e.g.,

require.NoError(t, err, "hover request should succeed")


	•	Never rename test packages from "x_test" to "x" unless absolutely necessary.

Mocks
	•	Mock Generation:
	•	Define interfaces and add them to .mockery.yaml.
	•	Generate mocks using:

./task mockery

(Mocks will be created in ./gen/mockery).

	•	Mocking Expectations:
	•	Always use .EXPECT() to set up expectations for mocks.

Debugging
	•	Pre-Change Validation:
	•	Run linting and tests before making changes to detect pre-existing errors.
	•	Error Ownership:
	•	Assume new errors are from your changes until proven otherwise.
	•	If an issue seems external, confirm before modifying shared code.
	•	Debugging Tools:
	•	Use github.com/k0kubun/pp/v3 for structured variable printing:

pp.Printf("Debugging value: %+v\n", myVar)


	•	Isolating Issues:
	•	Run specific tests to narrow down problems.
	•	Use -v sparingly—ensure test failures are still logged.
