 # imports:
always assume that broken imports are because the reference need to be adjusted, not because the thing being referenced doesn't exist
never directly modify go.mod or go.sum files, always use go mod tidy and go mod init to update them (or other commands that are appropriate)

# logging:
always use zerolog for logging
pass context.Context to zerolog.Ctx(ctx) to get a logger with context
all functions that log should have a context.Context as the first argument
context should be created as early as possible in the program and passed around to all functions that need it
individual packages should not define their own logging logic (unless required, like a server needing to control standard out), instead they should use the logger passed to them

# errors:
always use gitlab.com/tozd/go/errors for golang errors
always use errors.Errorf to wrap golangerrors, never use errors.Wrap
the wrapped error naming philosophy should always make the error message say what was trying to be done, not what went wrong (i.e. errors.Errorf("reading file: %w", err))
for new errors the name just needs to be the best name for that error

# running go
always use the ./go file defined in the root of this project as an alias for 'go'

# finding type definitions
use go doc to figure out what types youre working with look like
